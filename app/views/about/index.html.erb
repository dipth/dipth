<h1>About Thomas Dippel</h1>

<p>
  I'm a young professional web developer, rich on initiative, with years of experience.
</p>

<p>
  Web development has always been a big part of my life as far back as I can remember.
  And when I stumbled upon Ruby on Rails back in 2006 I knew that I had found something brilliant,
  and Rails has been my go to framework for developing websites and applications ever since.
</p>

<p>
  My professional career in software started as a .NET developer back in 2007 at a small Danish
  company called Smartlaunch Systems. We developed management solutions for Internet Cafés around
  the world, with focus on delivering the best and most user-friendly solutions on the market.
</p>

<p>
  As a result of my entrepreneurial personality I quickly rose to the title of CTO in 2009 and
  later as Managing Director of the Company.
</p>

<p>
  However, the changing situation in the market ultimately resulted in the company having to cut back,
  and I saw it as a chance to get back to my roots.
</p>

<p>
  In 2011 I started working as a full time web developer for a Danish magazine publisher, Benjamin Media.<br />
  Benjamin Media publishes the Danish magazines: M!, Bilmagasinet, Woman, Boligmagasinet, Costume, Vmax and others.<br />
  In my job I have had great focus on developing community-driven websites with strong usability and performance.
  Amongst other things, I have had the pleasure of optimizing their platform to handle twice the load that it was currently handling.
</p>

<p>
  I believe in open standards and open source, and try to give as much back to the community as possible.
</p>

<p>
  Apart from my work with web development I am also an avid photographer and cinematographer.
