<h1>About Thomas Dippel</h1>

<p>
  I'm a young professional web developer, rich on initiative, with years of experience.
</p>

<p>
  Web development has always been a big part of my life, as far back as I can remember.
  And when I stumbled upon Ruby on Rails, back in 2006, I knew that I had found something brilliant,
  and Rails has been my go to framework for developing websites and applications ever since.
</p>

<p>
  My professional career in software started as a .NET developer back in 2007, at a small Danish
  company called Smartlaunch Systems. We developed management solutions for Internet Caf√©s around
  the world, with focus on delivering the best and most user-friendly solutions on the market.
</p>

<p>
  As a result of my entrepreneurial personality I quickly rose to the title of CTO in 2009, and
  later as Managing Director of the Company.
</p>

<p>
  However, the changing situation in the market ultimately resulted in the company having to cut back,
  and I saw it as a chance to get back to my roots.
</p>

<p>
  So in 2011 I started working as a full time web developer for a Danish magazine publisher, Benjamin Media.<br />
  Benjamin Media publishes the Danish magazines: M!, Bilmagasinet, Woman, Boligmagasinet, Costume, Vmax and others.<br />
  In my job at Benjamin, I have focused on developing community-driven websites with strong usability and performance.
  Amongst other things, I have had the pleasure of optimizing their platform to handle twice the load that it was currently handling.
</p>

<p>
  In 2012 I quit my job at Benjamin Media to team up with the Danish Startup: Downtown.dk, to help them
  launch a brand new daily deal platform built on Ruby and Rails.
</p>

<p>
  Challenges is something that I seek in my daily life, and I try to learn something new every day.<br />
  Luckily the speed of which the web develops these days leaves a lot of new challenges for me to pick up.
</p>

<p>
  I strongly believe in open standards and open source, which is something that I try to bring to every project that I touch.<br />
  Whenever possible, I also try to give back to the community of open source, which I hope to do in an even bigger degree in the future.
</p>

<p>
  Apart from my work with web development I am also an avid photographer and cinematographer, from which I guess my keen sense of details originate.
</p>
